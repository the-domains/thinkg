1 SUSAN LK GORBET DESIGN STRATEGIST, EDUCATOR, FACILITATOR AND ARTIST. Susan mentors organizations on integrating design and business thinking. Most recently, she has developed a transformative program to bring design thinking and facilitation to the sales arm of a Fortune 50 software company. She holds a Master of Design from OCADU's Strategic Foresight and Innovation Program, and she has both studied and taught experience design, strategic foresight, design thinking, facilitation, creative thinking, innovation, design process and improvisation. Susan has been transforming cutting-edge technology into compelling experiences since the early '90s. In Toronto, she co-founded an art & design firm that creates connections between people and ideas by building large-scale interactive installations. Susan spent many years designing software in Silicon Valley where, after graduate research at Stanford, she evangelized experience design at Oracle, Silicon Graphics, Excite@Home and Snapfish.
